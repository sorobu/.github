## Why "Sorobu"?

In 1946, a Japanese Soroban operator beat an electric calculator in a speed contest in Tokyo. The centuries-old abacus won 4 out of 5 rounds, proving that well-designed tools beat raw computing power.

Sorobu brings that same philosophy to Notion: **elegant simplicity over complex limitations**.
